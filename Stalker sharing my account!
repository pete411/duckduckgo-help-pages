Leave me alone! 
I just made this profile just over two wks ago,hoping for more security,but apparently someone else has already been in my phone watching me,at all times! 
LEAVE ME ALONE!! 
I just want to live my life in peace,without the anxiety and PTSD,that you have made severely worse,over the last 5 years! 
I want to delete this app! Let me do that!! Back off! It's MY account! Not yours! 
Just stay out of my phone,and everything else you are in!
